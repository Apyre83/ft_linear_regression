```bash
git clone https://github.com/Apyre83/ft_linear_regression.git
cd ft_linear_regression
# It's recommended to use a virtual environment
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Features

- Predict car prices from mileage using a linear regression model.
- Data analysis and visualization of the training results.

## Usage

To run the model and make predictions, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Examples

Here's how to run the script to train the model and predict car prices:

1. Train the model with provided dataset:

```bash
python train.py
```

2. Predict the price for a car with specific mileage:

```bash
python predict.py 100000
```

This command predicts the price of a car with 100,000 miles.
